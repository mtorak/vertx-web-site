          <h3>Vert.x-Web purely functional handlers</h3>
          <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
          <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Eclipse Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. Use any function as a vertx-web handler, then provide an API to compose these functions in a "RouterBuilder API" way. This should be a totally separated project, keeping vertx-web as is for now and targeting "pure JVM languages" (Java, Kotlin, Groovy, Scala), especially those who have "first-level" functions (and maybe annotations).</p>

          <strong>What should be achieved:</strong>

          <ul>
            <li>any lambda can now be used as a vert.x web handler, automatically resolving lambda parameters.</li>
            <li>provide the ability to deal with futures in vert.x-web, if a lambda is returning an AsyncResult, then:
              <ul>
                <li>the next handler should only be called once the future is completed.
                <li>the context should automatically been failed if the asyncresult is failed.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>allow users to define custom parameters resolvers by implementing an interface such as Resolvable&lt;RoutingContext, T&gt; or AsyncResolvable&lt;RoutingContext, T&gt;.</li>
            <li>create a "builder-like" API on top of vertx-web's Router to deal with such lambdas.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For further reference and examples see the following <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vertx/01tCUjTm01s">google group post</a>.</p>

            <h3>Vertx-Web implement HTTP standard responses logic to Router</h3>
            <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
            <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Eclipse Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. Vert.x Web Router is a general purpose router that matches paths to handlers. Although this is "good enough" for many applications it does not adhere properly to the HTTP protocol. The issue is more obvious since the API allows filtering on mime type but failure to match such a request does not respect the protocol.</p>

            <strong>Current inconsistent cases:</strong>

            <ul>
              <li>A router contains a route path but with misses the right HTTP verb, instead of returning 404 it should return 405.</li>
              <li>A router contains a route for a specific mime type but the request contains a different payload mime type, instead of returning 404 it should return 406.</li>
              <li>A router contains a route that produces a specific mime type but the request requires a different payload mime type, instead of returning 404 it should return 415.</li>
              <li>An OPTIONS request should list the allowed verbs for the given path.</li>
              <li>Errors thrown during path parameter parsing should throw 400 instead of 500.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The project should start with a review of the HTTP protocol including version 2 and identify faulty situations as described above. A proposal for a refactoring of the internal of the Router class while keeping the existing API is a must.</p>

            <p>The code should be properly documented and easy to extend so later one can for example plug REST documentation generators, etc...</p>

          <h3>Implementation of “blueprint” Vert.x applications</h3>
          <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
          <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. The idea of the project is to implement a set of applications using the Vert.x toolkit to illustrate how different classes of applications can be done. This project aims to provide guidelines to Vert.x users to implement various applications.</p>
          <p>The project starts with an introduction to Vert.x and the implementation of small examples using the different modules available in the Vert.x ecosystem. Then, the first application is a web application to manage a todo list following the specifications of <a href="http://www.todobackend.com/">Todo Backend</a>. The second application is a message-based application such as <a href="http://automattic.github.io/kue/">Kue</a>. The third application is also message-based but illustrates the scalability of Vert.x. It provides a message processing system able to handle a large number of message per seconds. Finally, the last application is a micro-service application close to the <a href="https://github.com/kbastani/spring-cloud-microservice-example">Spring Micro Service example</a>.</p>
          <p>Live demo of the applications will run on OpenShift and OpenStack, to illustrate production deployment.
          All these applications will be available and documented on the Vert.x website.</p>

            <h3>DevOps tooling for Vert.x applications</h3>
            <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
            <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. The idea of the project is to implement a set of tools / guidelines to implement Vert.x using a “devops” approach. This cover continuous integration, continuous deployment, production settings and so on.</p>
            <p>The project starts with an introduction to Vert.x and the implementation of small examples using the different modules available in the Vert.x ecosystem. In this project, you are going to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>provide the different settings to use different log aggregator that can be used with Vert.x application. This includes Graylog and Heka.</li>
            <li>monitor applications based on New Relic, Netflix Servo are studied.</li>
            <li>provide deployment recipes for Ansible and Chef</li>
            <li>provide guidelines to implement continuous delivery of Vert.x application, in a zero-downtime environment</li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Event bus clients for C, Objective-C, and Rust applications</h3>
              <strong>Summary of idea:</strong>
              <p><a href="http://vertx.io">Vert.x</a> is a toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine enabling the implementation of reactive, highly concurrent, polyglot applications. Thanks to its eventbus, any application can interact with Vert.x applications. The idea of the project is to provide a set of libraries to ease the integration of Vert.x applications with applications developed in Go, Rust and C.</p>
              <p>The project starts with an introduction to Vert.x and the implementation of small examples using the different modules available in the Vert.x ecosystem. A focus is made on the integration capabilities and the event bus bridges.</p>
              <p>At least 3 languages are covered in this project: C, Objective-C and Rust. Proposals for other languages are definitely welcome. For each language, a library is developed in order to let an application developed with the language to interact with the Vert.x Event Bus. The communication is based on TCP and JSON.</p>
